# **Code of Conduct**

## **Welcome to the Project!**  
We value collaboration, respect, and quality contributions. This code of conduct outlines the expectations and best practices for contributing to this project.


## **General Guidelines**
- Treat everyone with respect and professionalism. Harassment, discrimination, or disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.
- Before starting work on an issue, ensure it is assigned to you to avoid duplication of effort.
- Follow the project-specific guidelines for coding style, folder structure, and conventions outlined in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](#).


## **Branching and PR Guidelines**
1. **Branching**  
   - All work must be done on a branch created from the `dev` branch.  
   - Use meaningful branch names with prefixes:
     - `feature/<feature-name>` for new features.
     - `bugfix/<bug-description>` for bug fixes.
     - `docs/<update-name>` for documentation updates.  
     Example: `feature/add-navbar-component`

2. **Pull Requests (PRs)**  
   - All PRs must target the `dev` branch.  
   - Include a **clear description** of the changes in the PR.  
   - Reference the issue being resolved (e.g., "Closes #123").  
   - Ensure your PR passes all linting and testing checks before submission.  
   - Add screenshots, GIFs, or videos if your PR affects the UI.

3. **Reviews and Approvals**  
   - Every PR requires at least one approval before merging.  
   - Respond promptly to review feedback and make necessary changes.  
   - Use constructive feedback to foster learning and improvement.


## **Issue Guidelines**
1. **Creating Issues**  
   - Search for existing issues before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.  
   - Use descriptive titles and provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and screenshots if applicable.

2. **Assigning Issues**  
   - Only work on issues assigned to you.  
   - If you're interested in working on an unassigned issue, comment on it to request assignment.

3. **Priority and Labels**  
   - Use appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `feature`, `documentation`) to categorize issues.  
   - Follow project maintainers' guidance on issue prioritization.


## **Code Style and Quality**
1. Follow the project's **style guide** for coding standards (e.g., ESLint, Prettier).  
2. Write **clear, modular, and reusable components** with proper documentation.  
3. Include meaningful commit messages:  
   - Example: `Add responsive navbar component`  

4. Test your changes:
   - Write unit tests for new components and features.  
   - Ensure changes don't break existing functionality.


## **Communication**
- Use the project's communication channels (e.g., Slack, Discord, GitHub Discussions) for questions or updates.  
- Be clear, concise, and respectful in all communications.


## **Acknowledgment**
We appreciate every contribution, no matter how small. Let's work together to build something amazing!
